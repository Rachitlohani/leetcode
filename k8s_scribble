Kubernetes has three Object Types you should know about:

Pods - runs one or more closely related containers
Services - sets up networking in a Kubernetes cluster
Deployment - Maintains a set of identical pods, ensuring that they have the correct config and that the right number of them exist.
Pods:

Runs a single set of containers
Good for one-off dev purposes
Rarely used directly in production
Deployment:

Runs a set of identical pods
Monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary
Good for dev
Good for production
And I would agree with other answers, forget about Pods and just use Deployment. Why? Look at the second bullet point, it monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary.

So, instead of struggling with error messages such as this one:

Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than spec.containers[*].image

So just refactor or completely recreate your Pod into a Deployment that creates a pod to do what you need done. With Deployment you can change any piece of configuration you want to and you need not worry about seeing that error message.
